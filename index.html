			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="../Responsive-Portfolio/TEST-ASSET/images/Randy.png" width="200" class="Me">

			<p> I am a nerd who thinks he is cool, says my wife. I love to cycle long distances on my bike with my
				family or friends, despite, having been hit by a car and having to learn how to walk again. My proudest
				moment was completing the MS 150 tour for cure. This was a two-day bike ride that was broken up into 75
				miles per day. During the last 25 miles I felt like I had an out-of-body experience, since I was so
				tired and fatigued that I could not feel my body anymore thus feeling like I was physically not there.
				Being from the south, I enjoy cooking all types of Cajun foods such as gumbo, red beans & rice, and
				shrimp etouffee. The southern experience has definitely played a part in who I am today, and I am
				blessed to have had that experience.</p>
